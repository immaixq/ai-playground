# ai-playground

A repository for exploring various Artificial Intelligence learning concepts, models, and techniques.

## Overview

This repository serves as a playground for different AI experiments. Each experiment focuses on a specific model, task, or learning approach. Below, you'll find a list of the currently implemented experiments with links to their detailed documentation.

## Experiments

### 1. Finetuning CLIP Image Encoder with Supervised Contrastive Learning

This experiment demonstrates how to finetune the image encoder of a CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) model using a supervised contrastive learning approach for image classification (cats vs. dogs).
